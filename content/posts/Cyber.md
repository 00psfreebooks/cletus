[Mozilla Updates Firefox Terms Again After Backlash Over Broad Data License LanguageMar 01, 2025Privacy / Data ProtectionFirefox browser maker Mozilla on Friday updated its Terms of Use a second time within a week following  criticism  overbroad language that appeared to give the company the rights to all information uploaded by users.  The revised  Terms of Use now states -  You give Mozilla the rights necessary to operate Firefox. This includes processing your data as we describe in the Firefox Privacy Notice . It also includes a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license for the purpose of doing as you request with the content you input in Firefox. This does not give Mozilla any ownership in that content.   A previous version of this clause, which went into effect on February 26, said -  When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.

[Amnesty Finds Cellebrite's Zero-Day Used to Unlock Serbian Activist's Android PhoneFeb 28, 2025Mobile Security / Zero-DayA 23-year-old Serbian youth activist had their Android phone targeted by a zero-day exploit developed by Cellebrite to unlock the device, according to a new report from Amnesty International.  "The Android phone of one student protester was exploited and unlocked by a sophisticated zero-day exploit chain targeting Android USB drivers, developed by Cellebrite," the international non-governmental organization said , adding the traces of the exploit were discovered in a separate case in mid-2024.   The vulnerability in question is CVE-2024-53104  (CVSS score: 7.8), a case of privilege escalation in a kernel component known as the USB Video Class (UVC) driver. A patch for the flaw was released for the Linux kernel in December 2024. It was subsequently addressed in Android earlier this month.  It's believed that CVE-2024-53104 was combined with two other flaws – CVE-2024-53197 and CVE-2024-50302 – both of which have been resolved in the Linux kernel. They are yet to be includ...](https://12ft.io/https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/amnesty-finds-cellebrites-zero-day.html)

[RDP: a Double-Edged Sword for IT Teams – Essential Yet ExploitableFeb 28, 2025Network Security / Endpoint SecurityRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is an amazing technology developed by Microsoft that lets you access and control another computer over a network. It's like having your office computer with you wherever you go. For businesses, this means IT staff can manage systems remotely, and employees can work from home or anywhere, making RDP a true game-changer in today's work environment.  But here's the catch: because RDP is accessible over the internet, it's also a prime target for unethical hackers. If someone gains unauthorized access, they could potentially take over your system. That's why it's so important to secure RDP properly.  Why IT Teams Depend on RDP, Despite the Risks  More than 50 percent of Kaseya's small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) customers use RDP for daily operations due to its efficiency and flexibility:   Reduces Costs and Downtime – IT teams can resolve technical issues remotely, eliminating travel expenses and delays.

[Fake CAPTCHA PDFs Spread Lumma Stealer via Webflow, GoDaddy, and Other DomainsFeb 28, 2025Network Security / MalwareCybersecurity researchers have uncovered a widespread phishing campaign that uses fake CAPTCHA images shared via PDF documents hosted on Webflow's content delivery network (CDN) to deliver the Lumma stealer malware.  Netskope Threat Labs said it discovered 260 unique domains hosting 5,000 phishing PDF files that redirect victims to malicious websites.  "The attacker uses SEO to trick victims into visiting the pages by clicking on malicious search engine results," security researcher Jan Michael Alcantara said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "While most phishing pages focus on stealing credit card information, some PDF files contain fake CAPTCHAs that trick victims into executing malicious PowerShell commands, ultimately leading to the Lumma Stealer malware."  The phishing campaign is estimated to have affected more than 1,150 organizations and more than 7,000 users since the second half of 2024, with the attacks primarily singling out victims in Nort...](https://12ft.io/https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/5000-phishing-pdfs-on-260-domains.html)

[Microsoft Exposes LLMjacking Cybercriminals Behind Azure AI Abuse SchemeFeb 28, 2025API Security / AI SecurityMicrosoft on Thursday unmasked four of the individuals that it said were behind an Azure Abuse Enterprise scheme that involves leveraging unauthorized access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) services in order to produce offensive and harmful content.  The campaign, called LLMjacking, has targeted various AI offerings, including Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service. The tech giant is tracking the cybercrime network as Storm-2139. The individuals named are -   Arian Yadegarnia aka "Fiz" of Iran,  Alan Krysiak aka "Drago" of United Kingdom,  Ricky Yuen aka "cg-dot" of Hong Kong, China, and  Phát Phùng Tấn aka "Asakuri" of Vietnam   "Members of Storm-2139 exploited exposed customer credentials scraped from public sources to unlawfully access accounts with certain generative AI services," Steven Masada, assistant general counsel for Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), said .

[12,000+ API Keys and Passwords Found in Public Datasets Used for LLM TrainingFeb 28, 2025Machine Learning / Data PrivacyA dataset used to train large language models (LLMs) has been found to contain nearly 12,000 live secrets, which allow for successful authentication.  The findings once again highlight how hard-coded credentials pose a severe security risk to users and organizations alike, not to mention compounding the problem when LLMs end up suggesting insecure coding practices to their users.  Truffle Security said it downloaded a December 2024 archive from Common Crawl , which maintains a free, open repository of web crawl data. The massive dataset contains over 250 billion pages spanning 18 years.   The archive specifically contains 400TB of compressed web data, 90,000 WARC files (Web ARChive format), and data from 47.5 million hosts across 38.3 million registered domains.  The company's analysis found that there are 219 different secret types in the Common Crawl archive, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) root keys, Slack webhooks, and Mailchimp API keys.

[The Ultimate MSP Guide to Structuring and Selling vCISO ServicesFeb 19, 2025Managed Services / Risk ManagementThe growing demand for cybersecurity and compliance services presents a great opportunity for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) to offer virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) services—delivering high-level cybersecurity leadership without the cost of a full-time hire.

[Sticky Werewolf Uses Undocumented Implant to Deploy Lumma Stealer in Russia and BelarusFeb 28, 2025Financial Fraud / Cyber EspionageThe threat actor known as Sticky Werewolf  has been linked to targeted attacks primarily in Russia and Belarus with the aim of delivering the Lumma Stealer malware by means of a previously undocumented implant.  Cybersecurity company Kaspersky is tracking the activity under the name Angry Likho, which it said bears a "strong resemblance" to Awaken Likho  (aka Core Werewolf, GamaCopy, and PseudoGamaredon).  "However, Angry Likho's attacks tend to be targeted, with a more compact infrastructure, a limited range of implants, and a focus on employees of large organizations, including government agencies and their contractors," the Russian company said .   It's suspected that the threat actors are likely native Russian speakers given the use of fluent Russian in the bait files used to trigger the infection chain. Last month, cybersecurity company F6 (formerly F.A.C.C.T.) described  it as a "pro-Ukrainian cyberspy group."  The attackers have been found...](https://12ft.io/https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/sticky-werewolf-uses-undocumented.html)

[Silver Fox APT Uses Winos 4.0 Malware in Cyber Attacks Against Taiwanese OrganizationsFeb 27, 2025Malware / Threat IntelligenceA new campaign is targeting companies in Taiwan with malware known as Winos 4.0  as part of phishing emails masquerading as the country's National Taxation Bureau.  The campaign, detected last month by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, marks a departure from previous attack chains that have leveraged malicious game-related applications .  "The sender claimed that the malicious file attached was a list of enterprises scheduled for tax inspection and asked the receiver to forward the information to their company's treasurer," security researcher Pei Han Liao said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The attachment mimics an official document from the Ministry of Finance, urging the recipient to download the list of enterprises scheduled for tax inspection.   But in reality, the list is a ZIP file containing a malicious DLL ("lastbld2Base.dll") that lays the groundwork for the next attack stage, leading to the execution of shellcode that's responsible for d...](https://12ft.io/https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/silver-fox-apt-uses-winos-40-malware-in.html)

[Space Pirates Targets Russian IT Firms With New LuckyStrike Agent MalwareFeb 27, 2025Malware / Network SecurityThe threat actor known as Space Pirates has been linked to a malicious campaign targeting Russian information technology (IT) organizations with a previously undocumented malware called LuckyStrike Agent.  The activity was detected in November 2024 by Solar, the cybersecurity arm of Russian state-owned telecom company Rostelecom. It's tracking the activity under the name Erudite Mogwai.  The attacks are also characterized by the use of other tools like Deed RAT , also called ShadowPad Light, and a customized version of proxy utility  named Stowaway , which has been previously used by other China-linked hacking groups.   "Erudite Mogwai is one of the active APT groups specializing in the theft of confidential information and espionage," Solar researchers said . "Since at least 2017, the group has been attacking government agencies, IT departments of various organizations, as well as enterprises related to high-tech industries such as aerospace and electric power....](https://12ft.io/https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/space-pirates-targets-russian-it-firms.html)

[89% of Enterprise GenAI Usage Is Invisible to Organizations Exposing Critical Security Risks, New Report RevealsFeb 27, 2025Artificial Intelligence / Browser SecurityOrganizations are either already adopting GenAI solutions, evaluating strategies for integrating these tools into their business plans, or both. To drive informed decision-making and effective planning, the availability of hard data is essential—yet such data remains surprisingly scarce.  The " Enterprise GenAI Data Security Report 2025 " by LayerX delivers unprecedented insights into the practical application of AI tools in the workplace, while highlighting critical vulnerabilities. Drawing on real-world telemetry from LayerX's enterprise clients, this report is one of the few reliable sources that details actual employee use of GenAI.  For instance, it reveals that nearly 90% of enterprise AI usage occurs outside the visibility of IT, exposing organizations to significant risks such as data leakage and unauthorized access.  Below we bring some of the report's key findings.

[New TgToxic Banking Trojan Variant Evolves with Anti-Analysis UpgradesFeb 27, 2025Cybercrime / AndroidCybersecurity researchers have discovered an updated version of an Android malware called TgToxic  (aka ToxicPanda), indicating that the threat actors behind it are continuously making changes in response to public reporting.  "The modifications seen in the TgToxic payloads reflect the actors' ongoing surveillance of open source intelligence and demonstrate their commitment to enhancing the malware's capabilities to improve security measures and keep researchers at bay," Intel 471 said  in a report published this week.  TgToxic was first documented  by Trend Micro in early 2023, describing it as a banking trojan capable of stealing credentials and funds from crypto wallets as well as bank and finance apps. It has been detected in the wild since at least July 2022, mainly focusing on mobile users in Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia.   Then in November 2024, Italian online fraud prevention firm Cleafy detailed  an updated variant with wide-ranging data-gathering featur...](https://12ft.io/https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/new-tgtoxic-banking-trojan-variant.html)
