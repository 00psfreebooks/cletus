He observes that Trump&rsquo;s inauguration initially sparked market enthusiasm, driving investors toward higher-risk assets. However, Sosnick notes that in the current climate, &ldquo;those are the stocks, actually, that are getting the rugs pulled out from them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Buy the rumor, sell the news. Well, in this case &mldr; there hasn&rsquo;t been the news that they&rsquo;re looking for to give the follow-through,&rdquo; he adds.
