Gapen highlights how post-COVID immigration surges boosted economic growth and labor supply while simultaneously tempering wage growth and inflation. He warns that if the US were to &ldquo;restrict immigration,&rdquo; this positive economic narrative could go into &ldquo;reverse,&rdquo; potentially hampering growth momentum. Addressing monetary policy implications, Gapen explains, &ldquo;The baseline view would be &mldr; trade restrictions, immigration restrictions — that should mean a slower growth, stickier inflation outlook, [and] a Fed that cuts but cuts later. The baseline isn&rsquo;t a recession, it&rsquo;s just a moderation in activity.&rdquo; To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
