href=https://12ft.io/https://finance.yahoo.com/video/big-tech-quantum-computing-could-164423398.html>Big Tech quantum computing could change the &lsquo;paradigm&rsquo;HarvestÂ PortfolioÂ ManagementÂ chief investment officer Paul Meeks and Milemark Capital founding partner Sinan Aral join Catalysts to compare the market capâweighted investing to equal-weight investing strategies, Nvidia&rsquo;s (NVDA) earnings performance, and the potential implications of quantum computing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve definitely seen a broadening out of the market where, for a long, long time, the market capâweighted S&amp;P was crushing the equal-weighted,&rdquo; Meeks says. &ldquo;But now we&rsquo;ve seen both are in sync, and actually the equal-weighted, at least 2025 to date, is outperforming.&rdquo; Aral discusses the future of quantum computing and how Nvidia is positioning itself in this space. He explains that while quantum computing represents a new change for hardware and chip technology, it is still in its early stages. &ldquo;As we see quantum develop, it could change the nature of the chips and therefore change the paradigm,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But all of these companies are investing deeply in that possibility.&rdquo; To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more CatalystsÂ here.
