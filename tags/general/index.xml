&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://12ft.io/https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidias-q4-success-fueled-hyperscalers-224800935.html">Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s Q4 success fueled by hyperscalers. Analyst explains.Nvidia (NVDA) experienced another impressive quarter — topping fourth quarter revenue and earnings estimates — largely driven by a handful of key customers. A significant portion of its success has been tied to cloud service hyperscalers. WestEnd Capital Management senior equity analyst Ali Mogharabi joins Market Domination Overtime&amp;rsquo;s Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the current state of Nvidia’s demand in the AI data center landscape. “In terms of the overall spending cycle, I think we&amp;rsquo;re still far from the peak,&amp;quot; Mogharabi says. &amp;ldquo;However, you know, based on the Q4 numbers and also on the guidance, it seems like the demand for Blackwell [GPUs], their latest one, is very, very strong — and one can only assume that actually is coming from the hyperscalers.&amp;rdquo; When asked about the competitive risk from Nvidia’s own customers, Mogharabi states, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;re seeing it, especially with with two of the hyperscalers: Alphabet&amp;rsquo;s (GOOG, GOOGL), the Google Cloud, and also Amazon (AMZN), the AWS. They have actually been utilizing their own chips, their in-house chips for a long time, especially Google.&amp;rdquo; Additionally, Mogharabi speaks on artificial intelligence advancements tying into customized chips. &amp;ldquo;At the same time, I do think that demand for more customized chips could actually increase, but you still need all of that computing power for a few reasons, right?&amp;rdquo; Mogharabi believes &amp;ldquo;as inference continues to improve, the application of all of this AI technology widens.” Watch Yahoo Finance&amp;rsquo;s full Nvidia earnings special here or catch the replay on streaming platforms at 8 pm E.T.
