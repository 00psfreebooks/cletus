Gapen highlights how post-COVID immigration surges boosted economic growth and labor supply while simultaneously tempering wage growth and inflation. He warns that if the US were to &amp;ldquo;restrict immigration,&amp;rdquo; this positive economic narrative could go into &amp;ldquo;reverse,&amp;rdquo; potentially hampering growth momentum. Addressing monetary policy implications, Gapen explains, &amp;ldquo;The baseline view would be &amp;hellip; trade restrictions, immigration restrictions — that should mean a slower growth, stickier inflation outlook, [and] a Fed that cuts but cuts later. The baseline isn&amp;rsquo;t a recession, it&amp;rsquo;s just a moderation in activity.&amp;rdquo; To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
