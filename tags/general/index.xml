He explains that while quantum computing represents a new change for hardware and chip technology, it is still in its early stages. &amp;ldquo;As we see quantum develop, it could change the nature of the chips and therefore change the paradigm,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;But all of these companies are investing deeply in that possibility.&amp;rdquo; To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
